// single client at a time:
//
//   getpubkey                          the 64-byte root public key, hex; "none" = no root
//   getowner                           generation of the record in force
//   takeown  <pubkey>                  claim; accepted only while the board has no root
//   setowner <gen> <pubkey> <sig>      hand over; refused unless the CURRENT owner signed
//   revoke   <leafhex> <sig>           revoke one leaf; refused unless the CURRENT owner signed
//   getapprevoked                      "yes" / "no" / "none" - was the installed image's signer revoked
//
// See $PROD/docs/modules/M2-ownership.md for why the first claim has no
// gate and every later one needs a signature. Revocation names a
// leaf by the first 16 bytes of its public key, not a tool-assigned number --
