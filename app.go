const usageText = `Usage:
  IAPTool cdc    <file.bin> <port>       [--key=<key.pem>] [--cert=<cert.txt>]
  IAPTool ether  <file.bin> <ip>         [--key=<key.pem>] [--cert=<cert.txt>]
                   uploads an application. A board with no root (new, or
                   factory-reset) is first claimed for the signing key; with no
                   key anywhere, one is generated at the default location below.
  IAPTool flashboot <boot.bin> <ip> --key=<owner.pem>
                   replaces the board's bootloader in place. --key must be the
                   owner root: a leaf certificate cannot authorise this. A board
                   with no root refuses it. Do not cut power during it.
  IAPTool sign   <file.bin> [<key.pem>]  [--key=<key.pem>] [--out=<prefix>]
  IAPTool genkey [<name>]    writes <name>.pem, or the default key location when no
                   name is given; prints the path and the public key
  IAPTool pubkey [<key.pem>] the key's public half as 128 hex characters, the form
                   "cert" and "getpubkey" speak. Send this to whoever holds the
                   root when you need a certificate issued for your key.
  IAPTool cert   [<leafPubHex>]
                   issues a 128-byte leaf certificate signed by the signing key,
                   hex on stdout. No argument = self-signed (simple mode: the key
                   authorises itself); a 128-hex-char public key = delegated leaf.
  IAPTool signraw <hex> [<key.pem>]  raw r||s signature over SHA-256 of those
                   bytes, hex on stdout. For the bootloader's owner-record
                   chain (setowner), not for firmware images.

  The commands below take <board>: a serial port (the board's USB port, answered
  only while it is in its bootloader) or an IP.
  IAPTool getowner <board>   which key this board trusts, and at which generation
  IAPTool getapprevoked <board> was this board's firmware signed by a leaf that has
                   since been revoked? Such firmware keeps running, so this is the
                   only way to find the boards worth re-uploading after a revoke.
  IAPTool takeown  <board> --key=<owner.pem>
                   claims a board with no root for that key, without uploading.
                   The first upload does the same by itself.
  IAPTool setowner <board> --current-key=<owner.pem> --new-key=<next.pem> [--wipe]
                   hands a claimed board over to another key. The handover is
                   signed by the current owner, so no button is needed.
  IAPTool revoke   <board> --key=<owner.pem> --leaf=<pubkey>
                   revokes one leaf (128-hex-char public key), signed by the
                   current owner. That leaf's next upload is refused; firmware
                   it already installed keeps running (see getapprevoked).
                   No button is needed. The root itself can never be revoked.

  --key            ECDSA P-256 private key (PEM). When omitted, falls back to
                   "signing_key" in local_config.json, then to
                   <user config dir>/openplc/keys/fw_signing_key.pem (the default
                   location), then to keys/fw_signing_key.pem next to this
                   executable. Uploading needs the private key itself: the image
                   is signed in memory and so is the board's challenge. To upload
                   from another computer, copy the key to the same place there.
  --cert           Certificate presented to the board, as issued by the holder of
                   the root it trusts. When omitted, falls back to "<the signing
                   key>.cert", and with no certificate there the signing key
                   certifies itself - which is what one person with one key wants.
  --out            Output prefix for "sign". Defaults to the .bin path without its extension.
  --wipe           For setowner only: also empty the revocation records, which is
                   the only way to reclaim revocation slots. The board rewrites
                   its state sector to do it and resets.
  --force          Flash even when the image is older than what the board runs.
                   One-shot: refused again until an upload arrives without it.
                   The Arduino IDE passes this from
                   Tools > Force flash (allow older version).

A factory reset (hold BOOT0 for 10 s) makes a board forget its root; the next
upload claims it again.`
